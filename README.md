# SEM1D-Homo1D

### Main Programs:
- `SEM1D.py` : python solver program of the shear elastic wave equation in 1D (Spectral Element Method)
- `Homo1D.py` : python homogeneisation program of the medium, density and shear modulus (2-scale non-periodic 1D homogeneisation)

### Tools Programs:
- `plotSEM1D.py` : tool to plot the files produced by `SEM1D.py` (traces, wavefields, source, material properties)

### Data directories
- `xwh_gll` : data needed for the SEM

### Documentation
The documentation is part of the programs, you can also refer to the examples.
